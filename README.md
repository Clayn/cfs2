# CFS 2
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Clayn/cfs2.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Clayn/cfs2)

The CFS 2 (ClaynsFileSystem not a good name though) is the second version of  an abstract file access layer. 
It provides an API to virtual directories and files. While e.g. the Java IO and NIO packages doesn't distingush between files and directories (besides some checks if a file/path is a directory which fails if the directory doesn't exist) this project gives you a clear view if you have a directory or file.
